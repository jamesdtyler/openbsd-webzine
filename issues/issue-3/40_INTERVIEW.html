<h2>Interview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For me, OpenBSD is a great platform to learn how computers work, even if 
it's a radically different OS compared to a GNU/Linux distribution or Windows.</p>
<p>When I started to use OpenBSD on an old Dell Optiplex G260, one thing that 
impressed me first was the quality of the man pages and the documentation. 
This might just be a small detail at first, but if you think about it, 
it means that you can find lots of information and some configuration examples 
without connecting to the Internet.<br/>In an era where everything goes into 
the "Cloud", it is always good to have a solid base near you, waiting to answer
your questions and ready to help you.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every good project should have a good documentation, like 
OpenBSD.</p>
