<h2>Interview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For me, OpenBSD is a great platform to learn how computers work, even if 
it's a radically different OS compared to a GNU/Linux distro or Windows.</p>
<p>When I started to use OpenBSD on an old Dell Optiplex G260, one thing that 
impressed me first was the quality of the man pages and the documentation. 
This might just be a small detail at first, but if you think about it, 
it means that you can find lots of information without connecting to the 
Internet.<br/>In an era where everything goes online, it is always good to have 
a solid base near you, waiting to answer your question and ready to help you.
