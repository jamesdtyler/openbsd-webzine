<h2>What's a hackathon?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently the h2k21 OpenBSD hackathon happened in Portugal, and I suppose it is hard to imagine what exactly happens there.</p>
<p>The OpenBSD hackathons occur a few times a year all across the world. Usually a week long, it's a time where developers can meet in real life.</p>
<p>It's the opportunity for everyone to hack on OpenBSD with many people around, ask for help, exchange ideas, get curious about other people's work while drinking one's favorite beverage</p>
<p>Hackathons are also a vacation trip, people are not absolutely bound to the hackroom, some groups get formed but some prefer to stay alone and visit the city or interesting areas around.</p>
<p>At every hackathon an artwork is created and shirts with the artwork are given to participants.</p>
<p>In the hackroom, the ambiance is very pleasant, many people behind their computers, but some are speaking, some coming back from a trip and offering local specialties to everyone.</p>
<p>Because many people are gathered in one place, code can be reviewed quickly and committed quickly, however with so many changes, sometimes things break but also get repaired quickly.</p>
<p>I think hackathons are a great part of the success of OpenBSD; it creates bonds between people among the project while it helps drive development for hard pieces requiring a few minds focused on a piece of the system.</p>
