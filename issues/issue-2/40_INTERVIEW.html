<h2>Interview</h2>
<blockquote>

OpenBSD is great as an OS, but also for it's side projects. My mail
server is using OpenSMTPD on OpenBSD. OpenSMTPD is very easy to
configure compared to other MTA.</p>

<p>
OpenBSD includes also a lot of various network tools that makes it a
great choice for routers. At home I set up two APU2 in redundancy as
personal router, as a commercial box replacement. Everything is
included: CARP makes it easy to manage IP failover mechanism, of course
the firewall pf, and other convenient tools like dhcpd and unbound.</p>

<p>BONUS: OpenBSD makes very easy to play beeper music, see <a class="permalink" href="https://man.openbsd.org/spkr.4">spkr(4)</a>.</p>

<p>To play the first notes of Bach's prelude in C minor (BWV 934)
(transposed to A minor to ease the writing), you need two OpenBSD boxes
with beepers, and pipe the two following strings on /dev/speaker on both
computers at the exact same time.</p>
