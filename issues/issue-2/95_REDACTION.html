<h2>Note from the editorial team</h2>
<p>We are very happy of the feedback we got from the community for the first release.  We will try to release a new issue every two weeks from now.  We still have no bot to automatically report news on Twitter or Mastodon (this is often asked) but we have an Atom feed, bots will come later.
</p>
<p>If you want to contribute, you can tell us how you use OpenBSD and why, we will be happy to publish your text.</p>
