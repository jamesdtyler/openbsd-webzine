    <quote>That's so cool! I love undeadly but it's great to also have this website, with interesting content I wouldn't 
normally come across. I'd have no idea that OpenBSD was installable on Gandicloud, for example. 
Or how to play Bach's prelude in C minor on OpenBSD using the MIDI speakers (issue #2). Thanks and keep up the great work!</quote>
