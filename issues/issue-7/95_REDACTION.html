<h2>Note from the editorial team</h2>
<p>
    Hello everyone. In the comments of the issue 6's post on Hacker News, I read that some people were a little bit confused about the style of this webzine and I wanted to clarify some points. With this webzine, we try to gather some
    links about updates from the OpenBSD project, but also some interesting links involving the usage of OpenBSD. Solène Rapenne, the creator of this project, is working in the OpenBSD team as a volunteer and she wanted, at first,
    to create a place to share her passion and to invite everyone to test and use this operating system. The editorial team is composed of people with various levels of skills, not only in IT, but we all share one thing : we all
    love OpenBSD and we want to share that love.
