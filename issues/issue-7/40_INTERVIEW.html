<h2>Interview</h2>

<div>
<p>For this issue, Solene@ accepted to reply to my questions for a short interview.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: Hello, could you briefly introduce yourself to the readers?</p>
<p><strong>Sol√®ne</strong>: My name is Sol√®ne, I'm a 32 years old woman living in west France. 
I have 11 years of experience as a freebsd/linux sysadmin. 
A few topics that interest me: Unix, gaming, minimalism and ecology.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: How did you join the project, and when?</p>
<p><strong>Sol√®ne</strong>: I join the OpenBSD project in April 2018, at the p2k18 Hackathon event. I've been invited by jca@ to join, the hackathon was happening near my living place so I had no excuse to decline. After a few days, I've been invited to join the Team and of course I accepted. I wrote my feelings about p2k18 on <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20180429101745">Undeadly</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: To my knowledge, you often work on packages integration and ports updates. How did you get into these kinds of tasks? Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>Sol√®ne</strong>: I started getting into packages and ports because it was at my reach in regards to skills, and it gives fast results so it's enjoyable. It's often easy to upgrade a simple port to a newer version fixing an annoying bug. Importing software in the ports tree is also fun, some people may not be able to use OpenBSD because a software they need is not available, bringing popular programs into the ports tree allow more people to use OpenBSD and give more choice to our fellow users. I also participate to some documentation work because I love documentation, making man pages more obvious or removing old references is easy and fun.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: In your opinion, what is your greatest contribution to the project?</p>
<p><strong>Sol√®ne</strong>: No doubt <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-announce&m=156577865917831&w=2">my name</a> is associated to the binary packages availability for our stable users.</p>

<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: How do you use OpenBSD outside of the development scope?</p>
<p><strong>Sol√®ne</strong>: There are many hardware at home running OpenBSD for different purpose.  My home router is running OpenBSD, using PF to fairly share the available bandwidth.  My laptop where I store all my important data and do development is running OpenBSD, I'm even playing some video games on it and publishing videos of it. My personal email server has been running OpenBSD for a long time too, it's absolutely reliable and maintenance free. Finally, I'm using a very old laptop, mostly offline, to keep a diary and listen to music or play nethack.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Sol√®ne for playing the interview game and talking about herself and her work!</p>
