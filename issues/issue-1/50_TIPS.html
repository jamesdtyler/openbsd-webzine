<h1>Shell tips</h1>
<p>
 With the default shell ksh, you may have noticed typing
 <code>history</code> would only display the last 10 lines of the
 history. This happens because history is an alias for the command
 <code>fc -l</code> which by default only displays the last 10 lines.
 Giving a number as a parameter to this alias will display the
 history from that number. Use <code>history 1</code> to display
 the complete history.
