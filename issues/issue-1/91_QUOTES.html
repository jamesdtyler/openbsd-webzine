        <li>if you want something conceptualy less broken, give plan9 a try</li>
        <li>if you want something more polished, give vim+coreutils a try </li>
        <li>if you want something convivialist, obenbsd is the best trade off i seen (you can also give try to sbase or 9base)</li> 
        <li>if you want something more consistent, let's start our project :)</li>
        <li>if you want something perfect, let it go :)</li>
