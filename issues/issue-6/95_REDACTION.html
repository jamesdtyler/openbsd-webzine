<h2>Note from the editorial team</h2>

    Hi, first I'd like to share my best wishes to everyone for 2022.  I've been in touch with a few people willing to translate the webzine into other languages, this is absolutely great but at this time the webzine's workflow does not handle translation.  I'll have to work on this to make the translations possible.  I have been very busy in December; I did not have much time to work on this issue and this is noticeable both in delay and content, but at the same time the OpenBSD project has been quite quiet for the period.
